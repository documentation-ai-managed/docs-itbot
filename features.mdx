## Page Creation and Hierarchical Organization

You start by creating pages directly in ITBot's editor. Each page supports nested children, forming a tree-like structure for logical navigation. Use the sidebar to drag and drop pages, ensuring your docs follow a clear hierarchy like `/introduction` > `/quickstart` > `/authentication`.

    A[Introduction] --> B[Quickstart]
    A --> C[Features]
    B --> D[Installation]
    B --> E[First Steps]
    C --> F[Editing]
    C --> G[Collaboration]
```

<Steps>

## Real-Time Collaboration and Comments

Invite team members to edit simultaneously. Changes sync instantly, with presence indicators showing who's active. Add threaded comments on any block for feedback.

<Callout kind="info">
  Enable version history to revert changes or compare edits.
</Callout>

To collaborate:

1. Share a page link with `{view}` or `{edit}` permissions.
2. @mention users in comments: `@team-member Review this section`.
3. Resolve comments once addressed.

## Search and Filtering Tools

ITBot's global search indexes all content. Filter by tags, page type, or date. Advanced queries support Boolean operators like `{docs AND api}`.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
  Use these operators:
  
  | Operator | Example | Result |
  |----------|---------|--------|
  | `AND` | `features AND collaboration` | Pages with both terms |
  | `OR` | `edit OR search` | Pages with either term |
  | `"` | `"real-time editing"` | Exact phrase match |
  | `-` | `docs -draft` | Exclude drafts |

  Tag-based filtering: `tag:feature`.
